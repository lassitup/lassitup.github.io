                    <h3>CSPB 2270 Data Structures Final Project - Financial Security Pledging Application</h3>

                    Attached is a link to my Github repository containing the results of my semester project for my CSPB 2270 course (Data Structures) Fall 2024 semester

                    Final Semester Project for CSPB 2270 Data Structures (Fall 2024). For this project, the class was tasked with choosing a data structure we have no used in class and come up with our own idea on how to use the structure. My project idea was creating an application to automate the security pledging process I perform daily in my job as a financial analyst. For this project, I implemented a Red-Black Tree to store and organize financial security data allowing for max search time complexity of O(logN). The program then performs a series of algorithms to ensure customer balances are sufficiently pledged and will export the change in securities pledged. Highlights of this project was the use of the red-black tree structure and heavy usage of pointer nodes for each security, customer and account. See the Readme in the Github link below for more information!

                    Attached is a link to my Github repository containing the results of my semester project for my CSPB 2824 course (Discrete Structures) Summer 2024 semester

                    The objective of this project was to create a Jupyter Notebook explaining in detail how the RSA Cryptosystem works and why it is secure. Within the project, I walk throught the necessary math to make the encryption / decryption scheme possible such as modular inverses, greatest common divisors, modular exponentiation, Bezout Coefficients and the algorithms / python functions used to apply these mathematical concepts such as the Euclidean Algorithm and Fast Modular Exponentiation. I also walk through how the RSA encodings can potentially be broken. Additionally, I've included a complete, independent version python program that includes a full user interface that allows the user to generate keys, encrypt / decrypt messages and attempt to break codes.

                    <h3>CSPB 1300 C++ Semester Final Project (Image Processing Application)</h3>

                    Attached is a link to my Github repository containing the results of my final project for my CSPB 1300 course (Computer Science 1: Starting Computing) Spring 2024 semester.

                    The objective of the project was to create an application using the C++ language, that can take a raw bitmap image, manipulate it and return a new image based on the user's desired image type. For the project, the class was provided a series of 10 algorithms for image processing in the Python language. For the project, I was required to translate the python code into C++ and then build a user interface, which allowed the user to enter the name of the input image names and select the desired process. The application allows for the user to graciously exit the program by selecting a letter to quit. This project showcases the major topics covered in the course as well as my grasp / understanding of these topics. These topics include variables, for loops, do while loops, input streams, functions, data types, algorithms, among others.

                    Attached is a link to my Github repository containing my semester long project for my CSPB 3112 course (Professional Development) Summer 2025 semester.

                    The objective of this class was to allow the student to decide on an area of Computer Science, about which the student would like to learn about and develop professionally in. For my project, I decided to learn about web development. This was an area of computer science that was completely new to me. My overall goal was to learn the underlying technologies used to make a full-stack website . This included HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end and then for the back-end, the node.js JavaScript runtime environment, express.js for the server and SQL/SQLite for the database. All of these new learned technologies were then used to build an e-commerce, full-stack website. In addition to the github repository, see the course page showing my progress on the project over the course of the semester here:<br><br>
