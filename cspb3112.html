                <p>
                    
                    With last week being the first week of the course, I spent most of my time familiarizing myself with the
                    overall course and going through the materials provided. I took some time to review the provided Github Pages
                    resources and went ahead and created the repository to hold my personal website. I also began thinking about What
                    my project for this class will be. I had an idea of what I wanted to learn coming in and ultimately decided 
                    what I will do. </br></br>

                    This week, I plan to start doing additional research on what skills will be needed to complete my project and put together my proposal. As I will lay out
                    in my project proposal, I plan to create a full stack e-commerce website and this will require me to learn a lot of new skills. 
                    From my initial research, I know that HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL are key ingredients in creating a fully functioning website. 
                    However, at this point, I'm still unclear as to what other technologies / libraries such as React or Angular I would need to learn
                    to make this work. At this point early on in the week, I've talked to someone that has some limited experience with web development
                    and began doing some research into these libraries. As I've never used any of these languages, and I'm not entirely sure yet how Javascript
                    interacts with an HTML doc but I feel I'll start to get a better idea of what is truly needed as I start learning them. Additionally for this week, as HTML and CSS are 100% going to be needed 
                    for this project, I've started learning these languages and as an update, I found I was able to learn HTML very quickly and, while
                    CSS syntatically is quite simple, it can be tricky at times, especially trying to position things! I'm getting some practice in 
                    using these new skills in building out my personal website. In terms of resources, I've found some really great courses on Codecademy
                    as well as various websites such as Mozilla (MDN), books and youtube videos to help me in the learning process. Going into the next week, 
                    I plan to keep learning some additional HTML/CSS before I move onto Javascript. I want to make sure I have a decent foundation in those
                    before I move on. Once I have a solid understanding in HTML/CSS, I feel I'll have a much better idea as to how to structure my project's website,
                    at least from design perspective.</br> </br>


                    Impediments for me would be trying to learn the new languages and managing my time with work, family, etc. Sometimes
                    I get too optimistic on what I want to get done for the week and things just get in the way. As I'm making use of 
                    the codecademy courses as my basis on getting start in the new languages, these courses are structured well, which gives
                    me targets to aim for in my learning for the session / day as I'm learning.</br></br>

                    Last week was somewhat light and sporadic. Going forward, I need to make sure I set aside dedicated time
                    to learn these languages and work on the project.
