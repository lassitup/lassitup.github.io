                <h3>Project Proposal</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="proposal_headers">Project Proposed:</span><br>For my project, I would like to create a full stack, e-commerce website.
                    My wife makes and sells custom jewelry using the flowers from funerals of passed-away loved ones. 
                    Business for her has grown and she would like to have an online presence. I thought that this would be the perfect 
                    opportunity to learn how to build a website. For my project, I will need to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL, 
                    which will give me experience using these web focused development languages and technologies. I plan to use Node.js / Express 
                    to create the server application that will provide the link between the site and the SQLite database. 
                    For purposes of this project, my research has shown that a SQLite database would be best for this project, 
                    since it will be housed locally and, for the time being, will only include mock data for learning purposes.<br><br>

                    <span class="proposal_headers">Vision statement:</span><br> how will this project expand your professional skills and knowledge?
                    One area of Computer Science that I&apos;ve never had any exposure to is web development. 
                    By setting out to build a full-stack, e-commerce web site, I am setting myself up to be exposed 
                    to and learn about a whole new sector of the profession. While building this project, I&aposm going 
                    to need to learn a whole suite of new languages and concepts. I have never touched HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
                    or SQL in my career, nor have I ever worked with Databases such as SQLite or PostgreSQL. Once I 
                    gain this experience, I feel it will make me a more well-rounded Computer Scientist as well 
                    as a more marketable candidate for internships and jobs.<br><br>

                    <span class="proposal_headers">Motivation: why is this project important to you?</span><br>
                    Web development is always something that has interested me, but I never had the time with the work load of other courses, 
                    job and family. There is something about creating a website/app than can be then used by anyone with an internet connection 
                    that really excites and motivates me to learn the technology behind it. Additionally, in my journey to switch from the accounting 
                    and finance world to software engineering, I&apos;ve been looking at internship job descriptions and a lot of them out there are focused 
                    on these web development technologies or would like to see experience with them. As this is one of my goals in the near future, 
                    I want to make myself more marketable for these opportunities and be able to speak to the technologies.
                    The specific idea of creating an e-commerce website stem from my experience of being an accountant. 
                    I felt this would be a natural fit for a first-time website. Also, with the product being offered on the 
                    site being my wife&apos;s custom-made jewelry, this is something personal that I could expand on and turn into a live website.<br><br>

                    <span class="proposal_headers">Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives) for the project. Remember that ~45 hours will be dedicated to the course and 
                    project over the 16-week (or 12-week summer) semester. You want to limit the scope of your project based on that time limitation.</span><br>
                    The overall objective of the project is to create an e-commerce website where a customer could enter the site, browse the offerings, 
                    make an order. The website will be able to record / retain the customer and sales information on a locally maintained database (for purposes of the project).
                    The business owner would then be able to log into the site and view and interact with the order details on the database such as approving 
                    the order and changing order status. Key elements of this project that I plan to learn and implement are as follows:
                    HTML and CSS &ndash; These are necessary to create the structure and design of the website.
                    JavaScript &ndash; This will enable the user to interact with the website
                    Node.js / Express &ndash; Using JavaScript outside of the browser to interact with the SQL database.
                    SQLite &ndash; A serverless and locally maintained RDBMS &ndash; This will be a good entry point for me 
                    to dive into learning how to interact with databases / learn SQL and not have to worry about having to host on more robust database engines.<br><br>

                     My overall goal is to gain experience in these web technologies and build a foundation of knowledge of how a website is built and runs. Ultimately, I will be able to 
                     prove to myself that I&apos;ve learned this foundation once I&apos;ve completed the website and it performs as expected.<br><br>

                    <span class="proposal_headers">Risks to project completion:</span><br>
                    New Technologies: The biggest risk for me in working on this is that all of these technologies are completely new to me. As I
                    previously noted, I have never been exposed to any of the languages necessary to create a website. While very exciting, 
                    diving into web development makes me a little nervous due to me &apos;breaking out on my own&apos;. By this I mean, 
                    in all my classes, we&apos;re essentially given what we&apos;re supposed to learn for the course, so that, in a sense, 
                    makes it easier &ndash; at least from a resource perspective. Learning a whole new computer science 
                    topic and then making something that works, independently, is a new type of journey for me, but I 
                    know this is a critical part of actually working in the field. I&apos;m excited to have this opportunity to do a project like this.<br><br>

                    <span class="proposal_headers">Time Constraints:</span><br> Another risk for me is just running out of time. Working a full time job as a CPA can sometimes be a little hectic 
                    and can sometimes get in the way of my learning, no matter how much I&apos;d rather be learning these new skill sets instead. 
                    Additionally, family life can sometime be a time consuming endeavor, especially having a toddler at home. Managing my time is 
                    going to be critical in making sure I can get through this project.<br><br>

                    <span class="proposal_headers">Scope Creep:</span><br> While I would actually like to make this a live website, there are a ton of things that I would eventually 
                    like to add to the site, but with this being my first time working with the web stack, I want to limit myself and make sure that 
                    I can create a site that has basic functionality and performs as expected before trying to expand it.<br><br>

                    <span class="proposal_headers">Mitigation Strategy for the risks listed above</span><br>
                    In order to mitigate the risks due to learning the new technologies, I&apos;ve been looking into resources that will help
                    me learn these languages. I&apos;m a structured kind of person. I&apos;m personally not a huge fan of just watching random 
                    Youtube videos to learn a new subject &ndash; I like to use these to complement or get targeted guidance. Instead, I like something 
                    that has path with clear learning objectives, especially when starting something new. I&apos;ve found some courses that cover the 
                    languages I need to learn on Codecademy so I plan to use these as a basis in learning the languages and then expand to other 
                    resources, such as books I&apos;ve accumulated or websites like W3 School, Geeksforgeeks and Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), 
                    which has some really good tutorials, as needed once I have a basic understanding. This will give me some much needed 
                    structure and allow me to set targets for myself for the day/week.
                    For mitigating the time issue; by setting up weekly goals for myself, this will help me stay on track and help me structure 
                    my week as I progress. Also, I plan to set aside time throughout the week to essentially detach myself from everything and 
                    focus on the project. Overall, I plan to spend a little more time than the time required for the course so I can thoroughly 
                    learn these new technologies and build my website.
                    To make sure that I stay in scope, I will lay out how I want the site to look and detail what features will be available to 
                    the site user before I begin. This will help me stay focused on what will be included on the site and allow me to focus in on 
                    what I need to learn to make it all work.<br><br>

                    <span class="proposal_headers">Project Assessments - provide a list of evaluation criteria for the project.
                    Describe how you will know that your project is completed and meets your goals.</span><br>
                    Completion of the Codecademy course work for learning the languages &ndash; will give me 
                    confidence that I&apos;m progressing with the languages and help me gauge where I&apos;m at or 
                    If I need to put more time into the language. Assess where my skills are currently at 
                    relative to the needs of the website. 
                    For example, although I want to learn everything, for the purposes of the project, 
                    I don&apos;t need to go into far more advanced JavaScript as necessary &ndash; it will just slow down completion of the project.
                    For the website project itself, there are a handful of main evaluation criteria.The website needs
                    to look good and provide a good user interface. Everything within the site where a user should be able to interact with 
                    the website, should work correctly and agree with the specifications I lay out for the site before beginning.
                    Data should be correctly posted to and pulled from the SQLite database.
                    I initially want to just have 3 main sections / pages of the website: the home page, the product page and an order page. 
                    Once I can get these working, I want to then start adding in additional features like allowing the site owner to access 
                    and interact with the order details via dashboard, have different types of products, allow users and the site owner to log 
                    in to accounts, etc.<br><br>


                    I used Generative AI to create a roadmap that I can follow as I begin learning the languages and begin working on my project. 
                    Just seeing this laid out gives me confidence that I can accomplish this in the allotted time frame. Of course, this most 
                    likely won't be followed exactly, but it gives me a good reference as to where I should be week to week as I progress.

                <h3>Week 2 Post (5/19/25 &ndash; 5/25/25)</h3>
                <p class="post">
                    <span class="blog_subtitle">What did you do last week</span><br>
                    With last week being the first week of the course, I spent most of my time familiarizing myself with the
                    overall course and going through the materials provided. I took some time to review the provided Github Pages
                    resources and went ahead and created the repository to hold my personal website. I also began thinking about What
                    my project for this class will be. I had an idea of what I wanted to learn coming in and ultimately decided 
                    what I will do. </br></br>
                    
                    <span class="blog_subtitle">What are you planning on doing this week</span><br>
                    This week, I plan to start doing additional research on what skills will be needed to complete my project and put together my proposal. As I will lay out
                    in my project proposal, I plan to create a full stack e-commerce website and this will require me to learn a lot of new skills. 
                    From my initial research, I know that HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL are key ingredients in creating a fully functioning website. 
                    However, at this point, I'm still unclear as to what other technologies / libraries such as React or Angular I would need to learn
                    to make this work. At this point early on in the week, I've talked to someone that has some limited experience with web development
                    and began doing some research into these libraries. As I've never used any of these languages, and I'm not entirely sure yet how Javascript
                    interacts with an HTML doc but I feel I'll start to get a better idea of what is truly needed as I start learning them. Additionally for this week, as HTML and CSS are 100% going to be needed 
                    for this project, I've started learning these languages and as an update, I found I was able to learn HTML very quickly and, while
                    CSS syntatically is quite simple, it can be tricky at times, especially trying to position things! I'm getting some practice in 
                    using these new skills in building out my personal website. In terms of resources, I've found some really great courses on Codecademy
                    as well as various websites such as Mozilla (MDN), books and youtube videos to help me in the learning process. Going into the next week, 
                    I plan to keep learning some additional HTML/CSS before I move onto Javascript. I want to make sure I have a decent foundation in those
                    before I move on. Once I have a solid understanding in HTML/CSS, I feel I'll have a much better idea as to how to structure my project's website,
                    at least from design perspective.</br> </br>

                    <span class="blog_subtitle">Are there any impediments in your way?</span><br>
                    Impediments for me would be trying to learn the new languages and managing my time with work, family, etc. Sometimes
                    I get too optimistic on what I want to get done for the week and things just get in the way. As I'm making use of 
                    the codecademy courses as my basis on getting start in the new languages, these courses are structured well, which gives
                    me targets to aim for in my learning for the session / day as I'm learning.</br></br>

                    <span class="blog_subtitle">Reflection on progress and improvements</span><br>
                    Last week was somewhat light and sporadic. Going forward, I need to make sure I set aside dedicated time
                    to learn these languages and work on the project.

                <h3>Week 3 Post (5/26/25 &ndash; 6/1/25)</h3>
                <p class="post">

                    <span class="blog_subtitle">What did you do last week</span><br>
                    Last week I spent a good amount of time researching what all what be needed to make my website work. I watched some youtube videos and read some sites about 
                    what the different components of web development are. I now have a better understanding of what things like Node.js and React are as before this week, I 
                    had absolutely no idea. It also makes me feel much better going into my project and makes me eager to get started. Additionally, I worked on building out my 
                    personal website (Still working on it!) from scratch with html and css (after I did some more tutorials on it) and I can say I've gotten a much better feel on how 
                    to lay out those flex box and grids! Also, this past week I worked on putting together my proposal for the course project.<br><br>

                    <span class="blog_subtitle">What are you planning on doing this week</span><br>
                    This week, once I have all of the course housekeeping items like doing the peer review of proposals completed and piazza posts in, 
                    I plan to do some review of HTML and CSS topics and put it to use by continuing to work on my personal site.  My overall plan is to dive into JavaScript,. 
                    so I want to put myself in a good spot on these languages before I move on. Also, I have spent a little time on CSS so I can get myself familiar with it, 
                    but I do want to explore one of the CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma that was recommended to look into. This is something I would like to utilize for my project. 
                    Additionally, time permitting, I'm going to begin sketching out the website for my final project - Depending on where I am, this may roll into next week.<br><br>

                    <span class="blog_subtitle">Are there any impediments in your way?</span><br>
                    Really the only impediment for me at this point is just time. Working full time just gets in the way of everything :D but I'm confident I'll be able to get through 
                    most of what I want. My family is very supportive and they try to give me time to focus.<br><br>

                    <span class="blog_subtitle">Reflection on progress and improvements</span><br>
                    I'm happy with where I'm at right now - Since I knew what I was wanting to learn even before the proposal, I've already got a head start on the HTML and
                     CSS front, so i'm actually a little ahead of my AI generated roadmap. I love being ahead of schedule, so I will continue pushing forward so I can continue to give myself that little extra wiggle room!

                <h3>Week 4 Post (6/2/25 &ndash; 6/8/25)</h3>
                <p class="post">
                    <span class="blog_subtitle">What did you do last week</span><br>
                    Last week I worked primarily on my proposal and making sure that I had a good plan in place to get started. I also continued some of the course work on CSS on Codecademy and put it into practice my working on my personal website. I've gotten it to a good point now, where it's presentable (My Website), but it's going to be one of those things I continuously update as I go. Honestly, I've been using it as a playground for trying out the new things I'm learning, so it will only get better! <br><br>

                    <span class="blog_subtitle">What are you planning on doing this week</span><br>
                    This week I started learning JavaScript, I'm not very far yet into the language - I really only covered basic syntax like your variables, functions, loops and conditionals. I was actually pleasantly surprised how quickly I was able to pick up the language. In part is because I'm already familiar with the major coding concepts like the aforementioned topics, but also the syntax (well at least pre ES6 syntax) is eerily close to C++ syntax. Some of the newer ES6 syntax like the arrow functions was new to me, but wasn't much of a problem once I worked through a couple examples. Another thing I'm in the process of doing right now is watching a beginner tutorial over Bootstrap on Freecodecamp. I'm glad I learned the basics of CSS, but it can be super tedious; however, you need know it if you want to alter the bootstrap classes. My personal site was all made from scratch and took a lot of tinkering, so in my project I'm hoping to utilize bootstrap to help with the front end design. In raw CSS, it was super delicate on making things work out how I want it to look, especially with the responsiveness, but Bootstrap uses a grid system based on flex boxes and so far it seems pretty easy to lay out it. I want to make sure I have good understanding on how to build out the page needed to use Boostrap's grid system - you have to structure your HTML file in a specific way using containers / rows / columns, which is different than in raw html/css flex/grid system. Once I have a good understanding and work out the examples with the tutorial, I'm going to start laying out my project site. I'm almost to the section of my course where you stat using JS to interact with the DOM, so I'm super excited to actually make JS do something.<br><br>

                    <span class="blog_subtitle">Are there any impediments in your way?</span><br>
                    This week I was hit was some kind of feverish, sickness that took me out of commission for a few days, but I'm on the mend. So trying to pace myself, but also keep up with everything. <br><br>

                    <span class="blog_subtitle">Reflection on progress and improvements</span><br>
                    Despite me being down a few days, I still feel like I was able to get back up and keep pushing forward. I think one of my problems is that I keep getting sidetracked as I'm working on stuff. For example, as I'm learning some basic JS concepts I want to dig deeper into how it works and then spend time looking at that. At this point I just need to keep myself on tasks and keep the objective in mind first.
